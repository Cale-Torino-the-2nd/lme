As part of a collaborative effort with [Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency](https://www.cisa.gov/), LME will soon be available via CISA's GitHub page and maintained in the same way LME via NCSC has been supported. Keep watching CISA's webpage for updates; they will have more information closer to the end of summer 2023. 
 
Since the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has made the decision to retire Logging Made Easy (LME) as of the **31st March 2023** this GitHub page is no longer maintained and has been archived.


A blog providing more detail around the original decision can be found [here](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/ncsc-to-retire-logging-made-easy).
